<p>A hotfix release for version 0.9.4. We have fixed several issues, but also made the extension more safe
    (which admittedly may have broken some things, so please let us know if we missed something).</p>

<p>We managed to snuck two minor features as well: ProtonDB links to app pages (turned off by default)
    and grey profile style for community pages.</p>
